# I_SPARK

This directory contains notebooks that train and run an ML model for seasonal hurricane prediction using XGBoost.

More data and info will be added over the coming months. For now, you can see all the forecast regions the model is taking into account for each different forecast month.

Below, check out the full poster about I-SPARK that's been presented at the American Geophysical Union conference in December 2024.
